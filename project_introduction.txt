My project is based on artificial intelliigence. It is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans, such as: speech recognition.The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols.This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
